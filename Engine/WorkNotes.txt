[2017.12.17] Created project from https://github.com/planetchili/chili_framework.git and upgraded to Visual Studio 2017 using auto-magic tools.
[2017.12.17] Built project successfully.
[2017.12.17] Migrated project manually (cuz I couldn't get it to copy magically) into my own repository https://github.com/ectrimble20/CppGame.git
[2017.12.17] Building and checking in as master branch
[2017.12.17] Adding some of the classes I've worked on using the Chili Framework for implementation into my game.
[2017.12.19] Reworked Rect class to be a logic container rather than an extension of the Surface.
[2017.12.19] Converted Rect to use float rather than int because positions etc are all float based with the Vector2 class
[2017.12.19] Tested SpriteSheet imports, setup preload for 4 images including a font I created.
[2017.12.20] Finally got Font to work how I wanted it to, able to print font to the screen. Working on making it less clunky
[2017.12.20] Need to fix the Font class.  Currently only works for square fonts, needs to work with rectangluar fonts such as 7x16
[2017.12.20] Fixed the Font class to work with mixed size fonts, also fixed a bug with the width/height causing weird behavior with unevenly sized fonts.
[2017.12.21] Removed "Surface(const std::string& bitmapFilename);" construct from Surface, we do not build directly from a BMP now.  Removed fstream import as well.
[2017.12.21] Built Singleton Logging class to allow me to log from anywhere to a single log file, should make debugging a bit easier now.
[2017.12.21] Updated some of Rect's methods for const correctness
[2017.12.21] Added button class, working out how it's going to behave
