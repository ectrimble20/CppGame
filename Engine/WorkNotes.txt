[2017.12.17] Adding some of the classes I've worked on using the Chili Framework for implementation into my game.
[2017.12.19] Reworked Rect class to be a logic container rather than an extension of the Surface.
[2017.12.19] Converted Rect to use float rather than int because positions etc are all float based with the Vector2 class
